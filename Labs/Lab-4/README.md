Please download all files, and when you want test them, run the command:

gcc -o main mainClass.c spaceStructure.c

Depending on you OS either run

1) Linux: ./main [number]
2) Windows: main.exe [number]

There are 3 allocation algorithms: First fit, Best fit, and Next fit.

**Just for Fun**
Simply run either of the commands above without the [number] part to see the options

1) First Fit
2) Best Fit
3) Next Fit

There isn't a function called "my_malloc", because I divided this one function into three different ones.
The function "my_free" is in the file spaceStructure.c

Keep in mind that it will take a while to display the results, since we are reading a big file, and these algorithms run until allocation
is not available.
